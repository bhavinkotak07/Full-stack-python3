# Full-stack-python3-and-flask
Fully working python3 code with flask framework and SqlAlchemy ORM. The course focuses on Python 2.7. I had issues with python 3 so I modified the code to work in version 3 and above environment.
To execute the code run "python lotsofmenus.py"
It will insert some data into sqlite database.
Now run "python webserver.py" to start a local server and the open localhost:8000/restaurant from browser.

Dependencies: SqlAlchemy
