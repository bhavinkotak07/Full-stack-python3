# Full-stack-python3
Fully working python3 code with flask framework and SqlAlchemy ORM. Udacity full stack web development course focuses on python 2.7 for application development. I have ported the code to Python 3.
<div>
Application is a restaurant management system where user can create , edit, delete and view restuarants. It uses sqlite database and inbuilt HTTPServer for hosting.
To execute the code run <code>"python lotsofmenus.py"</code>
It will insert some data into sqlite database.
Now run <code> "python webserver.py" </code> to start a local server and the open localhost:8000/restaurant from browser.

Dependencies: SqlAlchemy
