# Full-stack-python3
Fully working python3 code with flask framework and SqlAlchemy ORM. Udacity full stack web development course focuses on python 2.7 for application development. I have ported the code to Python 3. Application is a restaurant management system where user can create , edit, delete and view restuarants. It uses sqlite database and inbuilt HTTPServer for hosting.
To execute the code run "python lotsofmenus.py"
It will insert some data into sqlite database.
Now run "python webserver.py" to start a local server and the open localhost:8000/restaurant from browser.

Dependencies: SqlAlchemy
